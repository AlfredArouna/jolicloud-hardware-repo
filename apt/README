This "apt" directory will be symlinked from /etc/apt only when
jolicloud-hardware is actually running. The purpose being is that special
packages that need to be installed during boot-up can do so, because a
local repo cache is available.

If you literally see this README under /etc/apt and jolicloud-hardware is
not currently running, something seriously went wrong. Restore /etc/apt
from /etc/apt-orig.
